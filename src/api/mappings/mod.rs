//! Mapping service for converting API DTOs to domain models with value resolution.
//!
//! This module provides a clean separation between API models (DTOs) and domain models,
//! with support for resolving environment variables and secrets.
//!
//! # Structure
//!
//! - `core/` - Core mapping infrastructure (resolver, mapper traits)
//! - `sources/` - Source configuration mappers  
//! - `reactions/` - Reaction configuration mappers

// Core infrastructure

    pub mod mapper;
    pub mod resolver;

    pub use mapper::{ConfigMapper, DtoMapper, MappingError};
    pub use resolver::{EnvironmentVariableResolver, ResolverError, SecretResolver, ValueResolver};
}

// Server settings mapper
pub mod server_settings;

// Source mappers
pub mod sources;

// Reaction mappers
pub mod reactions;

// Re-export commonly used types at module root for convenience
