# Drasi Platform Example - Redis Stream Integration with Platform Bootstrap
# This example demonstrates using the platform source to consume events from Redis Streams
# with bootstrap data from a Query API service

sources:
  # Platform source - connects to Redis Stream to consume events with platform bootstrap
  - kind: platform

    # Stream position: ">" for new events, "0" to replay all (default: ">")
    start_id: "0"

    # If true, deletes and recreates the consumer group using start_id
    # If false, uses existing group position (ignores start_id if group exists)
