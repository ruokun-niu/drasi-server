# Drasi Platform Example - Redis Stream Integration with Platform Bootstrap
# This example demonstrates using the platform source to consume events from Redis Streams
# with bootstrap data from a Query API service

# Server: Drasi Server configuration

  host: 0.0.0.0
  port: 8080
  logLevel: info

# Sources: Define where data comes from
sources:
  # Platform source - connects to Redis Stream to consume events with platform bootstrap
  - kind: platform
    id: platform-redis-source
    autoStart: true
    # Platform bootstrap provider - fetches initial data from Query API
    bootstrapProvider:
      type: platform
      queryApiUrl: "http://localhost:8082"
      timeoutSeconds: 300
    # Redis connection URL
    redisUrl: "redis://localhost:6379"

    # Redis stream key to read from
    streamKey: "facilities-db-change"

    # Consumer group name for Redis Streams consumer group
    consumerGroup: "drasi-core"

    # Unique consumer name within the consumer group
    consumerName: "consumer-1"

    # Number of events to read per batch (default: 10)
    batchSize: 10

    # Milliseconds to block waiting for new events (default: 5000)
    blockMs: 5000

    # Stream position: ">" for new events, "0" to replay all (default: ">")
    startId: ">"

    # Always recreate consumer group on startup (default: false)
    # If true, deletes and recreates the consumer group using startId
    # If false, uses existing group position (ignores startId if group exists)
    # alwaysCreateConsumerGroup: false

# Queries: Continuous Cypher queries that process incoming data
queries:
  # Query to filter "Hello World" messages and return MessageId and From fields
  - id: hello-world-from

    # Cypher query: Match nodes with label "Message" and property Message="Hello World"
