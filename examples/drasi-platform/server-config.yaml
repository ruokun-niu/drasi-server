# Drasi Platform Example - Redis Stream Integration with Platform Bootstrap
# This example demonstrates using the platform source to consume events from Redis Streams
# with bootstrap data from a Query API service

# Server: Drasi Server configuration

# Sources: Define where data comes from
sources:
  # Platform source - connects to Redis Stream to consume events with platform bootstrap
  - kind: platform
    id: platform-redis-source
    auto_start: true

    # Stream position: ">" for new events, "0" to replay all (default: ">")
    start_id: ">"

# Queries: Continuous Cypher queries that process incoming data
